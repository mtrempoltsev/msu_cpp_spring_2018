# Homework 01
Computing sum of 2D-matrix elements in two different ways: by rows and by columns

## Running tests
This command will compile code and run programm on tests several times
```
./run.sh
```

## Manual building and running
To build project manualy:
```
make
```

To run project manualy:
```
./sum_by_rows
./sum_by_cols
```

## Cleaning directory
```
make clean
```

## Results
Running time for summation by rows: 0,25498s

Running time for summation by columns: 0,75137s

As we can see, the first algorithm is 3 times faster than the second one
